If this function is called the slider can be advanced a step by pressing the right arrow, and returned one step  by pressing the left arrow. When one presses and holds the right or left arrow  key, the slider will continue to move (as fast as graphics updating is possible on your system) up to the end or start slider position respectively.

The point distribution is for an equilateral triangle tesselation. The input  consists of the span in the x-, and y-direction, i.e. xSpan and ySpan  respectively, as well as the desired pointSpacing. The \"spans\" should be  vectors or tuples defining the minimum and maximum coordinates for the grid. The true point spacing in the x-direction is computed such that a nearest whole  number of steps can cover the required distance. Next this spacing is used to  create the equilateral triangle point grid. Although the xSpan is closely  adhered to through this method, the ySpan is not fully covered. In the  y-direction the grid does start at the minimum level, but may stop short of  reaching the maximum y as it may not be reachable in a whole number of steps  from the minimum. Optional arguments include return_faces (default is  false), which will cause the function to return triangular faces F as well  as the vertices V. Secondly the option rectangular will force the grid to  conform to a rectangular domain. This means the \"jagged\" sides are forced to be  flat such that all x-coordinates on the left are at the minimum in xSpan and all on the right are at the maximum in xSpan, however, this does result in a  non-uniform spacing at these edges.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"functions/#interp_biharmonic_spline","page":"Functions","title":"interp_biharmonic_spline","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"functions/","page":"Functions","title":"Functions","text":"Comodo.interp_biharmonic_spline","category":"page"},{"location":"functions/#Comodo.interp_biharmonic_spline","page":"Functions","title":"Comodo.interp_biharmonic_spline","text":"interp_biharmonic_spline(x::Union{Vector{T}, AbstractRange{T}},y::Union{Vector{T}, AbstractRange{T}},xi::Union{Vector{T}, AbstractRange{T}}; extrapolate_method=:linear,pad_data=:linear) where T<:Real\n\nInterpolates 1D (curve) data using biharmonic spline interpolation\n\nDescription\n\nThis function uses biharmonic spline interpolation [1], which features radial basis  functions.
