# GIBBON.jl
This Julia package aims to be a "one-stop-shop" for researchers in computational (bio)mechanics and computational design. It will feature tools for geometry processing, meshing, automated design / topology optimization, finite element analysis, as well as image processing and segmentation. In terms of finite element analysis linking with the open source solver FEBio is one of the targets. In addition, an interface for Gridap.jl will be added. 

In some sense GIBBON.jl is a modern re-implementation in Julia of the MATLAB toolbox [GIBBON (The Geometry and Image-Based Bioengineering add-ON)](https://github.com/gibbonCode/GIBBON). However, rather than literally porting each functional unit, it instead aims to follow a similar philosophy and cover the same core functionaly.
